# Rationale: CC0-1.0.txt contains the official plain text version of CC0 [1].
# From a copyright perspective, it‚Äôs OK to modify CC0‚Äôt text [2]. The caveat is
# that CC0 contains trademarks that are owned by Creative Commons [3]. Creative
# Commons does give us a license to use those trademarks, but that license
# stipulates that you can‚Äôt use those trademarks with modified versions of
# Creative Commons legal tools. CC0 is a Creative Commons legal tool [4], so if
# we modify CC0, then we have to remove any Creative Commons trademarks from it.
#
# Excluding CC0-1.0.txt makes sure that pre-commit won‚Äôt inadvertently encourage
# someone to modify CC0‚Äôs text. In general, legal text should be handled with
# care and not automatically modified by a tool.
#
# I‚Äôm also excluding CC0-1.0.txt.spdx-meta since it would be annoying to make
# that file and CC0-1.0.txt pass the assert_contains_regex hook.
