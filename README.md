# Jason’s Self-love Trainer

This repos holds what will eventually be an app that will help people practice
self-love.

## Hints for Contributors

If you decide to contribute to this project, then I hope that you’ll find the
following hints helpful:

- the `project` folder contains a [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) project.
- Use [Godot 4.0 RC 1](https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-0-rc-1/).
- Use tabs for indentation. The only exception to this rule is in YAML files
because [YAML requires spaces for
indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#61-indentation-spaces). In YAML files,
use 4 spaces for indentation.
- You can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your
contributions. Follow [these instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)
to get started. Skip [the part about creating a pre-commit
configuration](https://pre-commit.com/#2-add-a-pre-commit-configuration).
- Sometimes, it’s OK if a file doesn’t fully pass all of pre-commit’s checks. In
those cases,
[skip the failing hook(s)](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks).
